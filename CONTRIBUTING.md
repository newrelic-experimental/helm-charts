### Pull request approval and release process

A Github Action will run to lint and test the chart's installation. More information abouut it
can be found in the [Chart Testing documentation](CHART_TESTING.md).

A maintainer of the chart will review the changes and eventually approve them. Any change requires at least one review.
No pull requests can be merged until at least one maintainer reviews it. A good guide for what to review
can be found in the [Review Guidelines](REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md).

Once the Chart has been merged, the release will be automatically made by a Github Workflwo using the Github Pages of this repository.

## Support Channels

Whether you are a user or contributor, official support channels include:

- GitHub issues: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/charts/issues

Before opening a new issue or submitting a new pull request, it's helpful to search the project - it's likely that another user has already reported the issue you're facing, or it's a known issue that we're already aware of.
